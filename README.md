<p>News headlines play a crucial role in influencing stock price movements, as many investors base their trading decisions on the latest information. The sentiment expressed in these headlines—whether positive, negative, or neutral—directly affects the perception of a company's future performance, thereby impacting its stock price. Recognizing this, I have developed an advanced deep learning system that analyzes the sentiment of the top twenty news headlines related to a specific company to predict how its stock is likely to behave. By evaluating the emotional tone of the news, the system provides insights into whether a stock will rise, fall, or remain stable, offering valuable guidance to investors.

The deep learning system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand and process news sentiment effectively. Trained on a vast dataset of historical stock prices and corresponding news articles, the model identifies complex patterns and relationships between headline sentiment and stock price movements. This predictive capability allows investors to anticipate market shifts with greater accuracy, helping them make more informed decisions. By providing a more comprehensive view of how external news events shape stock prices, this system empowers investors to adopt a more strategic and data-driven approach to trading.</p>

<p>
To predict stock price behavior based on the top twenty news headlines, I have developed a deep learning model composed of two distinct sections. The first section employs two one-dimensional convolutional layers, each followed by a max-pooling layer and a dropout layer. The convolutional layers are designed to capture the most relevant features and patterns from the input text, allowing the model to recognize important sentiment cues across the news headlines. The max-pooling layers help reduce the dimensionality of the data, preserving essential information while minimizing computational complexity. The dropout layers are incorporated to prevent overfitting, enhancing the model’s generalization capability by randomly deactivating a subset of neurons during training.

The second section of the model consists of three fully connected dense neural network layers, which further process the extracted features and refine the predictions. Each dense layer uses the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, ensuring the model can learn complex, non-linear relationships in the data. The final dense layer, however, utilizes a sigmoid activation function to map the output to a probability range between 0 and 1. This allows the model to effectively predict the likelihood of a stock price increasing or decreasing, based on the sentiment extracted from the headlines. By combining convolutional layers for feature extraction with dense layers for decision-making, the model is able to deliver highly accurate predictions of stock price movements.</p>

<p>The model has been trained for five epochs. During training, the model uses Adam as an optimizer. The loss function used was mean square error to penalize the model more whenever it makes false predictions.</p>
